# Tutorial 2: Three-Phase Optimal Power Flow Formulation and Its Pyomo/Python Implementation 
This project is related to the implementation in Pyomo of a three-phase optimal power flow formulation developed by Pedro P. Vergara from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). This codes comes with a PDF file that explain in a very intuitive way how the derive mathematically the model and how to "translate" it into Pyomo/Python code.
